The current filetree was generated by running the following Snakemake pipeline:

/scratch/mutatex_collection/pablosanchezb

The scan folder hosts a custom scanning run performed with MutateX and the table folder
collects in a .csv file the predicted changes in folding free energy upon mutation for each protein residue.

The following files were provided as input to perform the scan with MutateX:
- APC/free/stability/mutatex_input_preparation/PDB_1-5/model_v1/saturation/mutate_runfile.txt
- APC/free/stability/mutatex_input_preparation/PDB_1-5/model_v1/saturation/repair_runfile.txt
- APC/free/stability/mutatex_input_preparation/PDB_1-5/model_v1/saturation/mutation_list.txt
The input .pdb file can be found in the folder:
APC/free/stability/mutatex_input_preparation/PDB_1-5/model_v1/saturation

The pipeline can be summarized as follows:
1. Generate input files and create a consistent input directory structure
2. Copy, if provided by the user, or download from AF Protein Structure Database, the .pdb file
from APC/structure_selection into APC/free/stability/mutatex_input_preparation/PDB_1-5/model_v1/saturation
3. Trim the .pdb file by using pdb_selres tool to consider only the user-specified residues
4. Run MutateX and generate a consistent output directory structure
5. Collect resulting energies in a .csv file
